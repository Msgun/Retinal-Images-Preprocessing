# Retinal-Images-Preprocessing
Image preprocessing on retinal images. The preprocessing methods applied here help prepare retinal images for a convolutional neural network based classification of diabetic retinopathy. It is based on Ben Grahams's Kaggle competition report, which can be found at the following link: https://kaggle-forum-message-attachments.storage.googleapis.com/88655/2795/competitionreport.pdf
